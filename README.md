# Weave

Hey there, Welcome to Weave. :wave:
Weave is Frabrics resource for all blockchain related objects and entities, more to come as we develop.

## prerequisites
You are going to need to install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle).
Once you have both installed, you will then need to run `npm install @openzeppelin/contracts` in this directory, to ensure that you have access to open zepplin templates.

## How to test
With that, you should be able to run `truffle test`
